<p>The <a href="https://riscv.org/2018/04/risc-v-workshop-in-barcelona-agenda/">eighth RISC-V
workshop</a> is
continuing
today in Barcleona. As usual, I&rsquo;ll be keeping a semi-live blog of talks and
announcements throughout the day.</p>

<h2 id="fast-interrupts-for-risc-v-krste-asanovic:a5d6ec65113439624abf306f86726737">Fast interrupts for RISC-V: Krste Asanovic</h2>

<ul>
<li>Embedded is a major use for RISC-V. There is a desire for faster interrupt
handling with support for nested preempted interrupts.</li>
<li>Summary of current RISC-V interrupts

<ul>
<li>Local interrupts are directly connected to one hart. There&rsquo;s no
arbitration between harts to service. Determine cause through xcause CSR.
Only two standard local interrupts (software, timer).</li>
<li>Global (external) interrupts are routed via the platform-level interrupt
controller (PLIC) which arbitrates between multiple harts claiming an
interrupt.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The machine interrupt pending (mip) CSR contains bits for local software,
local timer, and external interrupts (from the PLIC). It tells you which
interrupts are present.</li>
<li>mie mirrors the layout of mip, and allows you to enable/disable interrupts.</li>
<li>mstatus keeps track of interrupt status, containing a small interrupt stack.</li>
<li>The interrupt is reported in the mcause CSR. The exception code indicates
which interrupt was responsible - you might have to then interrogate the PLIC
if it was an external interrupt.</li>
<li>mtvec (machine trap vector base) contains the address of the trap vector
(&lsquo;base&rsquo;). It also contains bits which control whether interrupts are direct
(all exceptions and interrupts jump to base) or vectored (exceptions go to
base, interrupts are vectored).</li>
<li>There&rsquo;s two parts of an interrupt: what you were doing when it happened
(state context), and what you&rsquo;re going to do. mepc and mstatus allow the
contact to be saved and restored.</li>
<li>Problems with current interrupts:

<ul>
<li>Hardware preemption is only possible by switching privileged modes</li>
<li>Fixed priority for local interrupts</li>
<li>The vector table holds jumps instructions, which can only jump +/- 1MiB. A
free register would be required to jump further, resulting in even more
instructions.</li>
<li>PLIC has variable priority, but the vectoring must be done in software.</li>
<li>The PLIC needs two memory accesses: one to claim it, one to indicate
completion.</li>
<li>The Unix ABI (which is the only one that has been standardised) requires
many registers to be saved/restored.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Have had input via multiple proposals: Andes, Syntacore, Seagate, Liviu
Ionescu, SiFive</li>
<li>There have been discussions on the list about the interrupt handler
interface for software. It comes down to a choice between having the interrupt
handler as a regular C function (requiring save/restore of all caller-save
registers in hardware or software) or an inline handler which uses a gcc
interrupt attribute to convert the function to always callee-save every
register. Krste suggests both approaches are needed.</li>
<li>Krste explains how an &ldquo;interrupt&rdquo; attribute on a C function might work. In
this example, every register is callee-saved, so registers are saved as you
need to use them.</li>
<li>If you then went to call a function using the C ABI you need to save/restore
8 arguments, 7 temporaries, and 1 return address. Even more if you have to
save the floating point context. Krste argues that moving this to hardware
isn&rsquo;t enough, you need a new ABI to reduce the amount of state.</li>
<li>A number of options have been proposed for vectoring.

<ul>
<li>Having function pointers in a table. Downside is this is new functionality
you&rsquo;d have to add to a pipeline.</li>
<li>The SiFive proposal is to add a new +/-2GiB offset instruction which is
only visible in a new interrupt ISA mode. The advantage is the pipeline can
treat this as a regular instruction fetch, albeit with a different encoding.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Would like to allow each interrupt to be configured with its privilege mode
and the &lsquo;interrupt level&rsquo; which describes the preemption level, and a
priority.</li>
<li>To manage preempted context state it&rsquo;s necessary to push/pop
mepc/mpp/mil/mie to a memory stack. You also need to remember the previous
interrupt level, &lsquo;mil&rsquo;. Now multiple levels must be tracked, which Krste
proposes could be stored in mcause.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="risc-v-dsp-p-extension-proposal-chuan-hua-chang:a5d6ec65113439624abf306f86726737">RISC-V DSP (P) extension proposal: Chuan-Hua Chang</h2>

<ul>
<li>P extension task group will define and ratify a packed-SIMD DSP extension
containing instructions which operate on XLEN-bit integer registers. It will
also define compiler intrinsic functions that can be directly used in
high-level programming languages.</li>
<li>The initial proposal is based on the AndeStar V3 DSP ISA.</li>
<li>Supports e.g. 16-bit SIMD instructions with min, max, abs, compare, clip
operations. Similar for 8-bit SIMD.</li>
<li>GPR-based SIMD is more efficient for various embedded domains. It addresses
the need for high performance generic code processing as well as digital
signal processing.</li>
<li>Want to make this easy to use through intrinsic functions and optimised DSP
libraries.</li>
<li>For 64-bit data types, use pairs of GPRs on RV32. An implementation could of
course still use a 2R1W register file, but use multiple cycles to read a
64-bit value.</li>
<li>After the task group is created, bi-weekly meetings will be set up.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="security-task-group-update-richard-newell:a5d6ec65113439624abf306f86726737">Security task group update: Richard Newell</h2>

<ul>
<li>The security group was previously a task group of the technical committee.
There is now a new security standing committee, at the same level with the
marketing and technical committees.</li>
<li>Task groups will be set up to look at cryptograpshic ISA extensions and
trusted execution environments for microcontroller</li>
<li>The full charter will be published on riscv.org</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="formal-assurance-for-risc-v-implementations-daniel-m-zimmerman:a5d6ec65113439624abf306f86726737">Formal assurance for RISC-V implementations: Daniel M. Zimmerman</h2>

<ul>
<li>Galois started with a focus on cryptography, but has broadened its scope to
&ldquo;high assurance everything&rdquo;</li>
<li>There are a range of definitions for RISC-V. The human-readable instruction
manual, mechanisations in the form of software simulators or hardware
implementations. The formal model working group have also been working on
this.</li>
<li>How can we provide assurance about these definitions / mechanisations?</li>
<li>Assurance means: the system does what it is supposed to do and doesn&rsquo;t do
anything else.</li>
<li>When trying to get assurance through compliance tests, a huge burden is put
on the shoulders of the test writers. Those conformance tests need to be 100%
complete. This also doesn&rsquo;t help determine if an implementation has
undesirable behaviours.</li>
<li>Alternatively, formally verify your system. Compile a model to RTL via
clash, then use equivalence checking tools to compare against your own
implementation.</li>
</ul>
