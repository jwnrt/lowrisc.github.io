      <description>A few years ago lowRISC started developing a new LLVM backend targeting RISC-V. Rather than copying and modifying an existing backend, in an ad hoc fashion, we started from scratch and proceeded systematically. This approach proved successful in producing a high-quality codebase. We recently announced on the llvm-dev mailing list that the backend is now reaching stability and could be promoted from its current status of experimental to an official target.</description>

      <description>On Monday I proposed promoting the upstream RISC-V LLVM backend from &amp;ldquo;experimental&amp;rdquo; to &amp;ldquo;official&amp;rdquo; for the LLVM 9.0 release. Responses so far are extremely positive, and we&amp;rsquo;re working to ensure this is a smooth process. This means that from 9.0, the RISC-V backend will be built by default for LLVM, making it usable out of the box for standard LLVM/Clang builds. As well as being more convenient for end users, this also makes it significantly easier for e.</description>

      <description>Pretty much the whole team is in Zurich this week for the RISC-V Workshop and inaugural Week of Open Source Hardware, with a packed programme that got off to a start today and which runs all the way through to Friday afternoon.
This morning lowRISC board member, Professor Luca Benini, gave a RISC-V Workshop keynote entitled, Energy efficient computing from Exascale to MicroWatts: The RISC-V playground. Our friends and close collaborators at PULP Platform are giving a number of talks this week and, we’re pleased to say, so are members of the lowRISC team!</description>

      <description>At the beginning of many chips projects, there’s a dream. Could we create a more future-proof chip by embedding an FPGA fabric into it? Could we measure glucose levels more accurately by integrating a small bio lab onto a chip? Could we more reliably recognize kittens in a set of pictures by implementing neural network inference in hardware?
In implementation, this dream becomes a piece of hardware, with digital or analog logic, sensors, actuators, and much more.</description>

      <description>The lowRISC 0.5 milestone release is now available. The various changes are best described in our accompanying documentation, but the main focus is the integration of open-source Ethernet IP. The tutorial demonstrates how to use Ethernet support to boot with an NFS root, as well as with a rootfs on SD card.
Our main development focus currently is migrating to a newer version of the upstream Rocket chip design and reintegrating our changes on top of that, but we felt that the integration of Ethernet support merits a release before that change.</description>

      <description>This year, as part of Google Summer of Code we had the pleasure of working with Nikitas Chronas. Alongside his degree studies, Nikitas had become involved with the Libre Space Foundation and developed a strong interest in the possibility of open source hardware in CubeSats. Fault tolerance of some sort is important for harsh environments, and Nikitas worked to add fault tolerance through the implementation of core lockstep for the PULPino-based minion core subsystem.</description>

      <description>A high quality, upstream RISC-V backend for LLVM is perhaps the most frequently requested missing piece of the RISC-V software ecosystem. This blog post provides an update on the rapid progress we&amp;rsquo;ve been making towards that goal, outlines next steps and upcoming events, and tries to better explain the approach that we&amp;rsquo;re taking. As always, you can track status here and find the code here.

      <description>This summer, we were fortunate enough to have Katherine Lim join the lowRISC team at the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory as an intern. Katherine&amp;rsquo;s focus was on operating system and software enabled for lowRISC&amp;rsquo;s tagged memory, building upon our most recent milestone release. As Katherine&amp;rsquo;s detailed write-up demonstrates, it&amp;rsquo;s been a very productive summer.
The goal of this internship was to take the lowRISC hardware release, and demonstrate kernel support and software support for the hardware tagged memory primitives.</description>

      <description>There are a number of available options for building a RISC-V GCC toolchain. You might use the build system from the riscv/riscv-tools repository, or investigate toolchain generators such as crosstool-ng. However in the case of riscv-tools, it&amp;rsquo;s not always clear how this corresponds to the code in the relevant upstream projects. When investigating a potential bug, you often just want to build the latest upstream code with as little fuss as possible.</description>

      <description>The lowRISC 0.4 milestone release is now available. The various changes are best described in our accompanying documentation, but in summary this release:
 Moves forward our support for tagged memory by re-integrating the tag cache, reducing overhead with a hierarchical scheme. This will significantly reduce caches misses caused by tagged memory accesses where tags are distributed sparsely. Integrates support for specifying and configuring tag propagation and exception behaviour. A PULPino based &amp;ldquo;minion core&amp;rdquo; has been integrated, and is used to provide peripherals such as the SD card interface, keyboard, and VGA tex display (when using the Nexys4 DDR FPGA development board).</description>

OpenSoC System Architect: Farzad Fatollahi-Fard  Current architectures are wasteful. Only a small fraction of chip area goes to computation. For both GoblinCore and OpenHPC, ended up doing a lot of similar work to achieve only a point design. Why not make a generator to avoid repeating the same steps?</description>

      <description>The fifth RISC-V workshop is going on today and tomorrow at the Google&amp;rsquo;s Quad Campus in Mountain View. I&amp;rsquo;ll be keeping a semi-live blog of talks and announcements throughout the day.
Introduction: Rick O&amp;rsquo;Connor and Dom Rizzo  This workshop is yet again bigger than the last. 350+ attendees, 107 companies, 29 universities. The next workshop will be May 9th-10 in Shanghai, China.  RISC-V at UC San Diego: Michael Taylor  Startup software stacks today look a light like an iceberg.</description>

      <description>This blog post is a slight departure from the normal topics here. Worry not, we&amp;rsquo;ll return to discussing Verilog, Chisel, and low-level software work soon. I wrote a quick script to help serve a need (producing a Gantt chart) and thought perhaps others would find it useful.
There are a wide range of online services to help produce and maintain Gantt charts, but none quite offered what I was looking for.</description>

      <description>Many of the lowRISC team (Robert Mullins, Wei Song, and Alex Bradbury) have been in Boston this week for the fourth RISC-V workshop. By any measure, this has been a massive success with over 250 attendees representing 63 companies and 42 Universities. Wei presented our most recent work on integrating trace debug, which you&amp;rsquo;ll soon be able to read much more about here (it&amp;rsquo;s worth signing up to our announcement list if you want to be informed of each of our releases).</description>

      <description>Begnning on Monday, June 27th, we had a team of four University of Cambridge undergrads begin a 10 week internship working on the lowRISC project at the Computer Laboratory, kindly sponsored by IMC Financial Markets (who are also helping to advise this project). The team will be blogging regularly over the course of the summer - I&amp;rsquo;ll pass over to them to introduce themselves.
After some initial brainstorming, we decided to aim to extend the current lowRISC SoC design to enable video output, with the final goal of playing video smoothly at a resolution of 640x480 on FPGA.</description>

      <title>Untethered lowRISC release</title>
      <link>https://www.lowrisc.org/blog/2015/12/untethered-lowrisc-release/</link>

      <guid>https://www.lowrisc.org/blog/2015/12/untethered-lowrisc-release/</guid>
      <description>Over the past several months, we&amp;rsquo;ve been working to provide a standalone or &amp;lsquo;untethered&amp;rsquo; SoC. Cores in the original Rocket chip rely on communicating with a companion processor via the host-target interface (HTIF) to access peripherals and I/O. This release removes this requirement, adding an I/O bus and instantiating FPGA peripherals. The accompanying tutorial, written by Wei Song, describes how to build this code release and explains the underlying structural changes.</description>

      <description>Please join us October 9th-11th in Geneva, Switzerland for ORConf 2015. The event is kindly being hosted by CERN at the IdeaSquare. Last year&amp;rsquo;s ORConf was home to the first public talk on lowRISC and we&amp;rsquo;re delighted this year it will also be hosting a series of lowRISC and RISC-V discussions, serving as a European lowRISC and RISC-V workshop. ORConf has in recent years grown to cover a range of open source hardware topics beyond the original OpenRISC focus.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s the second day of the second RISC-V workshop today in Berkeley, California. I&amp;rsquo;ll be keeping a semi-live blog of talks and announcements throughout the day.
Z-scale. Tiny 32-bit RISC-V Systems: Yunsup Lee  Z-Scale is a family of tiny cores, similar in spirit to the ARM Cortex-M family. It integrates with the AHB-Lite interconnect. Contrast to Rocket (in-order cores, 64-bit, 32-bit, dual-issue options), and BOOM (a family of out-of-order cores).</description>

      <description>The second RISC-V workshop is going on today and tomorrow in Berkeley, California. I&amp;rsquo;ll be keeping a semi-live blog of talks and announcements throughout the day.
Introductions and welcome: Krste Asanović  The beginning of Krste&amp;rsquo;s talk will be familiar for anyone who&amp;rsquo;s seen an introduction to RISC-V before. Pleasingly, there are a lot of new faces here at the workshop so the introduction of course makes a lot of sense.</description>

      <description>lowRISC was fortunate enough to be chosen as a mentoring organisation in this year&amp;rsquo;s Google Summer of Code. The Google Summer of Code program funds students to work on open source projects over the summer. We had 52 applications across the range of project ideas we&amp;rsquo;ve been advertising. As you can see from the range of project ideas, lowRISC is taking part as an umbrella organisation, working with a number of our friends in the wider open source software and hardware community.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re pleased to announce the first lowRISC preview release, demonstrating support for tagged memory as described in our memo. Our ambition with lowRISC is to provide an open-source System-on-Chip platform for others to build on, along with low-cost development boards featuring a reference implementation. Although there&amp;rsquo;s more work to be done on the tagged memory implementation, now seemed a good time to document what we&amp;rsquo;ve done in order for the wider community to take a look.</description>
