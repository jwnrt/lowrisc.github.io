<p>The <a href="https://riscv.org/2017/10/7th-risc-v-workshop-agenda/">seventh RISC-V
workshop</a> is going
on today and tomorrow at Western Digital in Milpitas. I&rsquo;ll be
keeping a semi-live blog of talks and announcements throughout the day.</p>

<h2 id="introduction-rick-o-conor:b3d82df2c32815668820ecff5dcd0b9a">Introduction: Rick O&rsquo;Conor</h2>

<ul>
<li>Workshop is sold out, 498 attendees registered representing 138 companies
and 35 universities.</li>
<li>There will be 47 sessions squeezed into 12 and 24 minute increments, plus 26
poster / demo sessions.</li>
<li>The 8th RISC-V workshop will be held on May 7th-10th at the Barcelona
Supercomputing Center and Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya.</li>
<li>Rick gives a refresher on the structure of the RISC-V Foundation.</li>
<li>The RISC-V Foundation now has only 100 members (including individual
members).</li>
<li>We&rsquo;re on a <em>tight</em> schedule today. No applause and no questions!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="risc-v-state-of-the-union-krste-asanovic:b3d82df2c32815668820ecff5dcd0b9a">RISC-V state of the union: Krste Asanovic</h2>

<ul>
<li>Krste gives a rapid overview of the RISC-V ISA.</li>
<li>RISC-V aims to be simple, clean-slate, modulary, and stable.</li>
<li>RISC-V started in May 2010. v1.0 of the ISA came in 2011, first Rocket
tapeout in 2012, first Linux port in 2013, v2.0 (frozen) IMAFD spec in 2014.
First commercial softcores and first commercial SoC in 2017.</li>
<li>Large companies are adopting RISC-V for deeply embedded controllers in their
SoCs (&ldquo;minion cores&rdquo;), replacing home-grown and commercial cores.

<ul>
<li>[Editor&rsquo;s note: pleasing to see the &ldquo;minion core&rdquo; name take off around the
wider RISC-V community!].</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Small and proprietary-ISA soft-core IP companies are switching to the RISC-V
standard to access a larger market. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re a softcore IP provider, you
should have a RISC-V product in development&rdquo;.</li>
<li>RISC-V has seen government adoption, e.g. India adopted it as a national
ISA. A recent security-focused DARPA project standardised on RISC-V. Israel
Innovation Authority are creating the GenPro platform around RISC-V.</li>
<li>Many startups are choosing RISC-V for new products. &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t had to tell
startups about RISC-V; they find out about it very quickly when shopping for
processor IP&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Commercial ecosystem providers: starting to see mainstream commercial
support. &ldquo;Demand is driving supply in the commercial ecosystem&rdquo;.</li>
<li>RISC-V in academic research: becoming the standard ISA for academic
research. There will be talks at the workshop about the Celerity 500 RISC-V
core SoC in 16nm FinFET, and FireSim which models 1024 quad-core RISC-V
servers in the cloud.

<ul>
<li>The CARRV RISC-V workshop at MICRO was even better attended than the
machine learning workshop.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Expect in a few years time that the vast majority of undergraduates will be
taught RISC-V at University.</li>
<li>Racepoint Global have been hired for Foundation marketing.</li>
<li>RISC-V Technical Roadmap for 2017:

<ul>
<li>Primary goal was to formally standardise the base ISA, resolve issues with
the memory model, debug, and stabilize the privileged architecture.</li>
<li>Good progress has been made, but the spec hasn&rsquo;t yet been ratified. One of
the issues is differentiating the base spec versus clarifications for
different &ldquo;profiles&rdquo;. There is no plan to change any instruction
specification versus 2.0.</li>
<li>The Unix platform is stable as of the privileged 1.10 spec (i.e. no
backwards incompatible changes from now on).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>ISA specifications and profiles

<ul>
<li>The original ISA specs mixed instruction specifications with platform
mandates. Now work is ongoing to separate instruction set specifications
from platform profiles.</li>
<li>Instruction set specifications should be maximally reusable, while the
profiles should be as constrained as possible to simplify software
compatibility.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Single-letter names will run out some day, so a proposal has been made to
allow finer-grained naming of instruction sets to describe profiles. Use Zxxxx
to name standard instruction extensions (while Xyyyyy is used for non-standard
instruction extensions). See the isa-dev list for more information.</li>
<li>Profiles for software compatibility. A software ABI/SBI defines a profile.
A software ABI/SBI defines a profile. Also need profiles M-mode-only
microcontrollers, and MU-mode microcontrollers, and for booting MSU platforms.
Aim for have first ready in Q12018.</li>
<li>Memory model: the original was too weak for C11 and underspecified, but a
team of experts have come together over the past year to resolve the issues.
RVWMO is the base memory model and is weak, while RVTSO is an optional
extension providing a strong TSO memory model.</li>
<li>Calling convention and ABI has been stabilized and documented.</li>
<li>GCC and binutils have been upstreamed and released in GCC. LLVM upstream is
in progress.</li>
<li>A number of other compilers and languages are now available. e.g. CompCert,
Go, Rust, OCaml, Jikes JVM, OpenJDK, &hellip;</li>
<li>The Linux port has been accepted upstream for the 4.15 release.<br />
Additionally, the hypervisor spec has been released (designed to support
recursive virtualisation using an enhanced S mode).</li>
<li>Run-halt debug going well, is being targeted by commercial vendors.</li>
<li>2017 summary: All planned major technical decisions settled, some more work
on the ratification process is needed.</li>
<li>Technical roadmap goals for 2018:

<ul>
<li>Complete ratification of base ISA and first profiles</li>
<li>Base vector extensions proposed and ratified</li>
<li>Hypervisor implemented, spec ratified</li>
<li>Formal spec completed and released</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Vector: see the talk from Roger. Aim to be the Best Vector ISA Ever &trade;.</li>
<li>Security: really two separable efforts in the foundation: trusted execution
environments and cryptographic instruction extensions. Also a huge amount of
other work in the academic community.</li>
<li>Interrupts: currently have fast local interrupts and global platform-level
interrupts. Also have requests for high end systems who want per-hart
message-signal interrupts (MSI) and from low-end embedded that want
pre-emptive vectored prioritized interrupts.</li>
<li>Improving embedded compression: the C extension was designed for general
purpose computing with Unix binaries. People are seeing non-competitive RISC-V
code size on pure embedded workloads, like due to lack of byte/halfword memory
access? Considering an alternative C extension for RV32E systems.</li>
<li>A new task group has been up for the &lsquo;J&rsquo; extension, exploring support for
dynamically translated languages. Looking at issues like integer overflow,
garbage collection, and instruction cache management.</li>
<li>Summary

<ul>
<li>Very rapid development and adoption &ldquo;by the time you decide to do a
project, support will be there&rdquo;.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Question: does the foundation have any formal ways of addressing IP
challenges? Answer: have been documenting prior art for the base ISA
instructions. Would be good to continue to expand this to cover reference
hardware implementations.</li>
</ul>
